## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have previously created a slideshow using JS, but this time around, I learned how to make a slideshow with a gallery and added CSS effects when the picture is clicked. However, I encountered an issue where I had to reset the effect to 'none' when I click on another photo.
